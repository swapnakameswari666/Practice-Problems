Question: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

logic behind solution:
"i" is a range of numbers which consists of numbers between 1 and 1000.
we need numbers which are multiples of 3 and 5, that was checked by the if statement, which filters us the "i" those are multiples of either 3 or 5.
Then we need sum of the multiples of 3 and 5.
