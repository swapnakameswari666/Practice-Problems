we need to calculate sum of even fibonacci series, where the maximum value is 4000000.

Logic behind solution:

1. The sequence list consists of fibonacci numbers. Where the result list has the sum of even fibonacci numbers.
2. 'n' is the temporary variable, used to update the sequence list.
3. The addition of the last two numbers in sequence list gives the next number in that list.
4. The sum of even numbers is calculated and stored in the result.
